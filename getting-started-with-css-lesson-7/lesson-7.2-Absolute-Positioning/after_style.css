   Why did that happen??? 
   Well it's looking for a parent element with positioning.
   And if it can't find any it will then position it self relative to the view port.
   But isn't the h2 elements parent the .container class???
   That's right however the .container class doesn't have positioning so it chose
   the view port.
   If we give the the .container class some positioning then h2 will position
   it self relative to the .container class. */
